My name is Chaitanya Gokhale. I've worked in many roles like a data analyst, data scientist and software engineer. I'm originally from Pune, India, but I moved to USA in 2016 for 3.5 years where I did a master's degree and worked a bit.
I love most of the foods but I particularly like Indian foods being an Indian. Mexican ranks number 2 because ofcourse it has a bit of spice. I like to run and drink whiskey in moderation to wind down after busy work phases.
